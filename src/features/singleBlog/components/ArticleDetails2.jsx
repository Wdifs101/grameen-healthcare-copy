        Women in every society have remained as untapped power. Microcredit
        addressed unleashing that power. Not only it helped the family be self-
        reliant and come out of poverty, it also empowered women socially and
        politically. Unleashing the entrepreneurial capacity of women transform
        the society in every aspect, not just economically, but socially,
        politically and health wise.
