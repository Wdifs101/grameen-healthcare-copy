        <Typography variant="p" className="block">In cataract surgery your natural clouded lens will be replaced by an artificial intraocular lens (IOL). This lens helps the incoming light rays to focus properly on your retina, thus enabling you to see clearly. Your new lens should be able to restore vision to nearly what it was earlier, though you may need to wear glasses for reading or driving.</Typography>
        <Typography variant="p" className="block">The lens options include MONOFOCAL lenses – corrects distance vision, and MULTIFOCAL lens – corrects distance, intermediate and near vision. In some cases light does not focus correctly on the retina and the image appears distorted even after implanting monofocal or multifocal lenses. This happens when the shape of the eye is not circular resulting in distorted vision – a condition called as astigmatism. In such cases an option of customized “toric monofocal lenses” or “toric multifocal lenses” can be used.</Typography>
